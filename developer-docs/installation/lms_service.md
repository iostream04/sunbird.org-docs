   * [Enviroment Variables](#set-env)
   


### Setup Cassandra<a name="setup-cassandra"></a>

1. Install Cassandra database and start the server (Use Cassandra version 3.*)
2. Clone the repository (sunbird-lms-mw)[https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-lms-mw]
3. Goto sunbird-lms-mw/service/src/main/resources
4. Run [cassandra.cql] file to create the required keyspaces, tables and indices
 use " source 'sunbird-lms-mw/service/src/main/resources/cassandra.cql' " in cqlsh terminal. 
 
5. Copy pageMgmt.csv and pageSection.csv to a temp folder on cassandra machine. (e.g.: /tmp/cql/pageMgmt.csv and /tmp/cql/pageSection.csv.)
6. Execute the below commands in terminal .


``` 
	   cqlsh -e "COPY sunbird.page_management(id, appmap,createdby ,createddate ,name ,organisationid ,portalmap ,updatedby ,updateddate ) FROM '/tmp/cql/pageMgmt.csv'"
       cqlsh -e "COPY sunbird.page_section(id, alt,createdby ,createddate ,description ,display ,imgurl ,name,searchquery , sectiondatatype ,status , updatedby ,updateddate) FROM '/tmp/cql/pageSection.csv'"
```

  7.Clone the repository (sunbird-utils)[https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-utils] 

  <pre>
   $ cd {sunbird-utils folder}/cassandra-migration/
   $ mvn clean install -U -DskipTests
   $ mvn exec:java
  </pre>
  8. For verifing cassandra installation please use following command.
  
    -> Step 7 should be completed without any errors.
